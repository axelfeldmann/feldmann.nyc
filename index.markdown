I am a third year PhD student studying computer architecture at MIT. I'm advised by Professor [Daniel Sanchez](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez/). I am interested in working across the hardware-software interface: designing new hardware, but also building the software needed to efficiently use it.

I'm currently working on [accelerating fully homomorphic encryption.](./micro21_fhe.pdf)

I did my undergrad at CMU. There, I got started in computer architecture research with Professor [Nathan Beckmann](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~beckmann/).
I had summer internships at Nvidia and beloved 90s tech company Yahoo.
